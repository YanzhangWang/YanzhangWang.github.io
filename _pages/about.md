I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr. Junqing Zhang](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/). My research interests include **Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF)** and **adversarial attacks and defenses** for wireless systems.

Prior to my PhD, I received my BEng degree in Mechatronics and Robotic Systems jointly from the University of Liverpool and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU). During my undergraduate studies, I developed a broad foundation in robotics, computer vision, and intelligent systems, and gained hands-on experience through research projects and industry internships.

## Research Interests

- Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF)
- Adversarial Attacks and Defenses
- Deep Learning for Wireless Security
- Physical-Layer Security

## Education

- **PhD, Electrical Engineering and Electronics** (2025 – present) — University of Liverpool, UK
- **BEng, Mechatronics and Robotic Systems** (2021 – 2025) — University of Liverpool & Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University

## Previous Research Experience

**Intelligent Elderly Care System** — SURF Program, XJTLU, Supervisor: Dr. Yushan Pan *(2023)*  
Developed a YOLOv8-based human pose estimation system to monitor elderly daily activities and alert caregivers in real time. Trained models using the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

**Human-Machine Collaboration in Intelligent Manufacturing** — Intelligent Collaborative Lab, XJTLU, Supervisor: Dr. Yushan Pan *(2022 – 2023)*  
Designed a robot arm system using RGB color recognition (OpenCV/Python) for industrial part sorting. Conducted 16 observation sessions and semi-structured interviews to guide user-centered iterative design. This work led to a publication at ICVR 2023.

**Stress Sensing Glass Crack Identification** — Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen *(2024)*  
Developed MATLAB-based image processing pipelines to detect and classify cracks in smart material glass (piezoelectric ceramics, shape memory alloys) for intelligent manufacturing applications.
